"I just had to program in order to be happy... 
adding a couple lines of code gave me a real high,

\section{INTRODUCTION}

When we think of programming software, what comes to mind?  Data structures, 
algorithms, zeros and ones? As we explore just what "The Art of Programming" is,
we discover just how sophisticated our programming languages have become 
since the days of Assembly Code and binary. We start to see just how creative
programming actually is. Similar to a composer instructing a symphony to create
the perfect sound, a programmer creates complex literature, conversations between 
humans and machines.

Programming is more solution-based and not based on artistic heuristics, so it is 
not generally considered an art form. But looking closer, programming is in fact art,
of course. It is also science, engineering, and design. Software programming is so 
widespread and important in our society that it is all these things at once.

\section{TIME PERIOD}

It is uncertain as to when programming first started. One can argue that programming first started during the birth of mathematics, many years before the $20^{th}$ century, and even before the dawn of the first millennia. Though the period when programming first started is debatable, one thing is for certain, the era of programming is not ending any time soon. Computers and technology vastly encompass our society and our dependency on them has grown. The art of programming is an evolving aspect of human society. As our needs grow, so too do our problems, and with them, our thinking. Humans are great thinkers and problem solvers, we solve problems people from the past cannot comprehend. Programming is an aspect of problem solving and as our society evolves, the art of programming evolves with it. As Jamie Zawinski said, "the software is not complete, until its last user is dead."

\section{COMPUTER HARDWARE}

You should list the specification of any hardware your topic
uses here. If you want make a table here, please label the table
and include discussion on what components are included in the
table and why. See Table
\ref{tbl:example} for an example of a table.
The labels/captions of the table should be put at the bottom
of the table.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c||} 
\hline
  & Col1 & Col2 & Col3 \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
Row1 & (1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) \\ 
\hline
Row2 & (2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) \\
\hline
Row3 & (3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of a table}
\label{tbl:example}
\end{center}
\end{table}

You might want to put figures in the document. Please
remember to label them. The labels/captions of the figures
should be put at the bottom of the figure. See Figure
\ref{fig:example} for an example of how to use figures.
You will need to place the figure in an \texttt{images/} folder
in your working directory.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Example of a figure}

\section{COMPUTER SOFTWARE}

The art of programming depends highly on software; what good is a machine if the tasks it can complete is highly limited? Programming helps machines become fluid, allowing them to complete more tasks and solve more problems. Programming languages are extremely paramount in software development. The languages vary depending on what tasks need to be accomplished. Consider machine language; computers cannot understand words and diction on their own. They only understand mathematical languages of binaries and hexadecimals. However, humans are also slow at comprehending machine language on its own, so the art of programming needed to evolve. Humans developed programming languages that are easier to understand for both us and the machine. Programming languages allow us to talk to machines. To past societies, such a skill would be incredibly alien, and considering with what we can achieve with it, it is almost godlike. 

\section{CONCLUSION}
